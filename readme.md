### Introduction

<p>Flurby is a Discord bot that I started working on in December 2020. He's a side project to experiment with JavaScript and Node.js, as well as to get some practice reading through API documentation. I used the Discord.js module to help with interacting with the Discord API.</p>

<p>We started making heavy use of Discord in the Spring '20 semester at UAFS when COVID-19 attacked, so I figured it would be a good time to start a project that was relevant and could possibly be of use to the computer science department. For now, Flurby lives in my personal Discord server with all my friends. Once I get enough features added and all the bugs sorted out, I may open him up to be invited to other servers.</p>

### Features

<p>Flurby has a very limited set of features at the moment. I'll continue to add more as I learn about the Discord API and webhooks. For now, he can send random gifs and give magic 8-ball answers.</p>
